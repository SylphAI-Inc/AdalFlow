Thought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.
Action 1: search("Colorado orogeny")
Observation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.
Thought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.
Action 2: lookup("eastern sector")
Observation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.
Thought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.
Action 3: search("High Plains")
Observation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:
Thought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).
Action 4: search("High Plains (United States)")
Observation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]
Thought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.
Action 5: finish("1,800 to 7,000 ft")""",
"""Question: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the "The Simpsons" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?
Thought 1: The question simplifies to "The Simpsons" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.
Action 1: search("Milhouse")
Observation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.
Thought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up "named after".
Action 2: lookup("named after")
Observation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. 
Thought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.
Action 3: finish("Richard Nixon")""",
"""Question: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?
Thought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.
Action 1: search("Adam Clayton Powell")
Observation 1: Could not find ["Adam Clayton Powell"]. Similar: ['Adam Clayton Powell III', 'Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)', 'Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building', 'Isabel Washington Powell', 'Adam Powell', 'Adam Clayton Powell (film)', 'Giancarlo Esposito'].
Thought 2: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).
Action 2: search("Adam Clayton Powell (film)")
Observation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.
The film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.
Thought 3: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.

Thought 1: I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.

Observation 1: Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 – June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.
Thought 2: Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor. I need to search Elia Kazan next and find his professions.
Action 2: search("Elia Kazan")
Observation 2: Elia Kazan was an American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter and actor.
Thought 3: Professions of Elia Kazan are director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. So profession Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common is director, screenwriter, and actor.
Action 3: finish("director, screenwriter, actor")""",
"""Question: Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?
Thought 1: I need to search Arthur's Magazine and First for Women, and find which was started first.
Action 1: search("Arthur's Magazine")
Observation 1: Arthur's Magazine (1844-1846) was an American literary periodical published in Philadelphia in the 19th century. 
Thought 2: Arthur's Magazine was started in 1844. I need to search First for Women next.
Action 2: search("First for Women")
Observation 2: First for Women is a woman's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989. 
Thought 3: First for Women was started in 1989. 1844 (Arthur's Magazine) < 1989 (First for Women), so Arthur's Magazine was started first.

Thought 1: I need to search Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin, find their types of work, then find if they are the same.
Action 1: search("Pavel Urysohn")
Observation 1: Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (February 3, 1898 â August 17, 1924) was a Soviet mathematician who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory.
Thought 2: Pavel Urysohn is a mathematician. I need to search Leonid Levin next and find its type of work.
Action 2: search("Leonid Levin")
Observation 2: Leonid Anatolievich Levin is a Soviet-American mathematician and computer scientist. 
Thought 3: Leonid Levin is a mathematician and computer scientist. So Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin have the same type of work.
