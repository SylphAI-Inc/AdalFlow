"""
Splitting texts is commonly used as a preprocessing step before embedding and retrieving texts.

We encourage you to process your data here and define your own embedding and retrieval methods. These methods can highly depend on the product environment and may extend beyond the scope of this library.

However, the following approaches are commonly shared:

* **Document Storage:** Define how to store the documents, both raw and chunked. For example, LlamaIndex uses `Document Stores <https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/storing/docstores/>`_ to manage ingested document chunks.

* **Document Chunking:** Segment documents into manageable chunks suitable for further processing.

* **Vectorization:** Embed each chunk and store the resulting vectors in Vector Stores. For example, LLama index utilizes `Vector Stores <https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/storing/vector_stores/>`_.

* **Retrieval:** Leverage vectors for context retrieval.

    Text Splitter for Chunking Documents

    ``TextSplitter`` first utilizes ``split_by`` to specify the text-splitting criterion and breaks the long text into smaller texts.
    Then we create a sliding window with length= ``chunk_size``. It moves at step= ``chunk_size`` - ``chunk_overlap``.
    The texts inside each window will get merged to a smaller chunk. The generated chunks from the splitted text will be returned.

    **Splitting Types**

    ``TextSplitter`` supports 2 types of splitting.

    * **Type 1:** Specify the exact text splitting point such as space<" "> and periods<".">. It is intuitive, for example, split_by "word":

    ::

        "Hello, world!" -> ["Hello, " ,"world!"]

    * **Type 2:** Use :class:`tokenizer <adalflow.core.tokenizer.Tokenizer>`. It works as:

    ::

        "Hello, world!" -> ['Hello', ',', ' world', '!']

    This aligns with how models see text in the form of tokens (`Reference <https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/How_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken.ipynb>`_),
    Tokenizer reflects the real token numbers the models take in and helps the developers control budgets.

    **Definitions**

    * **split_by** specifies the split rule, i.e. the smallest unit during splitting. We support ``"word"``, ``"sentence"``, ``"page"``, ``"passage"``, and ``"token"``. The splitter utilizes the corresponding separator from the ``SEPARATORS`` dictionary.
    For Type 1 splitting, we apply ``Python str.split()`` to break the text.

    * **SEPARATORS**: Maps ``split_by`` criterions to their exact text separators, e.g., spaces <" "> for "word" or periods <"."> for "sentence".

    .. note::
        For option ``token``, its separator is "" because we directly split by a tokenizer, instead of text point.

    * **chunk_size** is the the maximum number of units in each chunk.

    * **chunk_overlap** is the number of units that each chunk should overlap. Including context at the borders prevents sudden meaning shift in text between sentences/context, especially in sentiment analysis.


    * **Splitting Details**
    Type 1:
    The ``TextSplitter`` utilizes Python's ``str.split(separator)`` method.
    Developers can refer to

    .. code-block:: none

        {
            "page": "\\f",
            "passage": "\\n",
            "word": " ",
            "sentence": "."
        }
    for exact points of text division.

    .. note::
        Developers need to determine how to assign text to each data chunk for the embedding and retrieval tasks.

    Type 2:
    We implement a tokenizer using ``cl100k_base`` encoding that aligns with how models see text in the form of tokens.
    E.g. "tiktoken is great!" -> ["t", "ik", "token", " is", " great", "!"] This helps developers control the token usage and budget better.

    * **Merge Details**
    Type 1/Type 2 create a list of split texts. ``TextSplitter`` then reattaches the specified separator to each piece of the split text, except for the last segment.
    This approach maintains the original spacing and punctuation, which is critical in contexts like natural language processing where text formatting can impact interpretations and outcomes.
    E.g. "hello world!" split by "word" will be kept as "hello " and "world!"

    * **Customization**
    You can also customize the ``SEPARATORS``. For example, by defining ``SEPARATORS`` = {"question": "?"} and setting ``split_by`` = "question", the document will be split at each ``?``, ideal for processing text structured
    as a series of questions. If you need to customize :class:`tokenizer <adalflow.core.tokenizer.Tokenizer>`, please check `Reference <https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/How_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken.ipynb>`_.

    * **Integration with Other Document Types**
    This functionality is ideal for segmenting texts into sentences, words, pages, or passages, which can then be processed further for NLP applications.
    For **PDFs**, developers will need to extract the text before using the splitter. Libraries like ``PyPDF2`` or ``PDFMiner`` can be utilized for this purpose.
    ``LightRAG``'s future implementations will introduce splitters for ``JSON``, ``HTML``, ``markdown``, and ``code``.

    .. code-block:: python
