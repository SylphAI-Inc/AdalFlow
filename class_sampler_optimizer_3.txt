system_prompt_str: You are a classifier. Given a Question, you need to classify it into one of the following classes:
Format: class_index. class_name, class_description
0. ABBR, Abbreviation
1. ENTY, Entity
2. DESC, Description and abstract concept
3. HUM, Human being
4. LOC, Location
5. NUM, Numeric value

<OUTPUT_FORMAT>
Your output should be formatted as a standard YAML instance with the following schema:
```

system_prompt_str: You are a classifier. Given a Question, you need to classify it into one of the following classes:
Format: class_index. class_name, class_description
0. ABBR, Abbreviation
1. ENTY, Entity
2. DESC, Description and abstract concept
3. HUM, Human being
4. LOC, Location
5. NUM, Numeric value
