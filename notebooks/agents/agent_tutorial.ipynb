    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrated advanced AdalFlow agent features:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Human-in-the-Loop Features\n",
    "- **Basic Permission Management**: Tools requiring user approval before execution\n",
    "- **Auto-Approval Mode**: Automatic approval for development environments\n",
    "- **YOLO Mode**: Bypass all permission checks for trusted environments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Streaming Capabilities\n",
    "- **Basic Streaming**: Real-time execution events\n",
    "- **Raw Response Streaming**: Access to raw model outputs\n",
    "- **Agent Event Streaming**: High-level execution events\n",
    "- **Multi-Provider Streaming**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, and other providers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tracing and Monitoring\n",
    "- **Basic Tracing**: Built-in execution tracing\n",
    "- **MLflow Integration**: Enterprise-grade tracing and monitoring\n",
    "- **Async Generator Tools**: Advanced streaming tool execution with tracing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "1. Explore permission management for production deployments\n",
    "2. Set up MLflow for comprehensive tracing: `mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080`\n",
    "3. Experiment with streaming for real-time applications\n",
    "4. Check the AdalFlow documentation for more advanced features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits\n",
    "- **Safety**: Human oversight for critical operations\n",
    "- **Transparency**: Full visibility into agent execution\n",
    "- **Performance**: Real-time streaming for responsive applications\n",
    "- **Monitoring**: Enterprise-grade tracing and analytics"
