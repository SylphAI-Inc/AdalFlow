In a remote desert canyon, scientists discovered a colony of glowing insects called "Lunaflits." These
creatures produce bioluminescence to attract mates and ward off predators. Unlike fireflies, Lunaflits
emit a constant, soothing green light that illuminates the canyon at night. The canyon walls are covered
with a rare moss that reflects their light, creating an ethereal glow. Researchers have found that Lunaflits
communicate through rhythmic light pulses, forming intricate patterns. Local legends claim these insects
are guardians of ancient treasure buried deep within the canyon.
