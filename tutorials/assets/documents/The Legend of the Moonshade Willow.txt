In the mystical village of Elmsworth, a rare tree known as the "Moonshade Willow" blooms once every seven
years. Its blossoms emit a soft glow, and villagers believe that meditating under its branches brings vivid
dreams of the future. The tree's bark is said to contain a secret resin used in ancient healing rituals. Elders
claim the Moonshade Willow was a gift from a goddess to protect the village. Despite its sacred status,
researchers have discovered that the tree thrives only in Elmsworth's unique soil, making it impossible to
cultivate elsewhere.
