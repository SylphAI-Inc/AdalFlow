LightRAG Contribution Guide
=======================================
``LightRAG``'s contribution process is similar to most open source projects on GitHub. We encourage new project ideas and the communication between ``LightRAG`` team, developers and the broader community.
Please don't forget to join us on `Discord <https://discord.com/invite/ezzszrRZvT>`_.

Contribution Process
----------------------------
You are always welcomed to contribute even if you've never participated in open source project before.
Here is the basic contribution process:

Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When contributing, please note:
LightRAG separates the source code environment and documentation environment.

* To activate the code environment, you should run ``poetry install`` and ``poetry shell`` under ``./lightrag``. The ``./lightrag/pyproject.toml`` contains the dependencies for the ``LightRAG`` package.

* To activate the documentation environment, you can run ``poetry install`` and ``poetry shell`` under ``.``. The ``./pyproject.toml`` controls documentation dependencies.

Find a direction to work on
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The team builds ``LightRAG`` based on latest researches and product cases. But you might have your own task to apply ``LightRAG``.
Therefore, you can extend ``LightRAG`` and add any new features you believe will solve yours or others' problems.
If you don't have any idea yet, you can:

* Check the `existing issues <https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/LightRAG/issues>`_ and see if there is anyone you know how to fix or you'd love to fix.

* Join us on `Discord <https://discord.com/invite/ezzszrRZvT>`_. We are glad to discuss with you and know what you are interested in here.

Figure out the scope of your change
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Small:** Most of the pull requests are small. If your change is small, such as fixing a line of bug, please go ahead to push it.

**Big:** But if you are making a new feature, or planning to push a large change, it is recommended to contact us on `Discord <https://discord.com/invite/ezzszrRZvT>`_ first.

**Unknown:** If you have no idea how big it will be, we are here to help you. Please post your idea on `issues <https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/LightRAG/issues>`_. We will read it carefully and get back to you.
