Chain of the thought(CoT) is to mimic a step-by-step thought process for arriving at the answer. You can achieve it in two ways:
1. Add instructions such as "Let's think step-by-step to answer this question".
2. Add few-shot examples such as
'
Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?
A: Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cansof 3 tennis balls each is 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11.
'

NOTE: CoT can be helpful for more complicated task, it also varies from task to task and model to model.
For instance, CoT might already be supported in gpt3.5+ api calls.

Benchmark it with and without CoT to see if it helps.
