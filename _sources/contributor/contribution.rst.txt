Contributing Process
=======================================
Welcome to the AdalFlow community!

We tried to make the process simple and clear, but it can always improve.
Share your suggestions on `Discord <https://discord.com/invite/ezzszrRZvT>`_ or `Github Discussion <https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/AdalFlow/discussions>`_.


Quick Start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. The `Github issues <https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/AdalFlow/issues>`_ is the best place to find your first task. Look for tasks labeled `good first issue`.
2. Follow the :doc:`./contribute_to_code` to set up your environment and start coding, testing, and documenting.
3. Review the `PR & Review Process <#pr-review-process>`_ to complete the review and iteration process.
   We aim to maximize both your learning and the library's quality.


.. note::

   You can use üëç to show that you want a particular issue to be addressed.

Part 1: Structuring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To dive deeper, we‚Äôll explain our repository structure, issue tracking, and label system.

..  what to contribute(with examples), contributing steps with proposal/discussion/coding/testing/documentation/pr/review process.
.. The coding and testing will be discussed more in details in `Code Contribution Guidelines <./contribute_to_code.html>`_ and the documentation will be discussed in `Documentation Contribution Guidelines <./contribute_to_document.html>`_.

Repo Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our repository has a clear structure, divided into six subdirectories:

.. code-block:: text

1. The ``/adalflow`` directory contains the source code for the `AdalFlow` library,including its implementation, tests, and a dedicated `pyproject.toml` file.
2. The ``/docs`` directory houses the documentation for the `AdalFlow` library and also includes its own `pyproject.toml` file.
   We use `reStructuredText` for the documentation.  For more details, please refer to `README.md <https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/AdalFlow/blob/main/docs/README.md>`_ under the ``./docs`` directory.
3. Additionally, it includes the following directories:

   - ``/tutorials``: Contains tutorials for the `AdalFlow` library, for each core feature or class.
   - ``/use_cases``: Covers various use cases, likely end to end applications even with auto-optimization.
   - ``/benchmarks``: Includes benchmarks to evaluate the library with other libraries or frameworks.
4. ``/notebooks`` directory contains all notebooks used across `tutorials`, `use_cases`, and `benchmarks`.



Issue & Label System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We use issues to manage bugs, features, and discussions.
To organize them, we‚Äôve carefully designed **15** labels.


.. figure:: ../_static/images/adalflow_issues.png
   :alt: AdalFlow Issues
   :align: center
   :width: 700px

   **Type**: The type of the issue, such as bug, feature, or discussion.

We use three categories of labels in parallel:

* Type of issue: There are 7 types of issues.

  - ``[adalflow]`` indicates the issue relates to `AdalFlow` source code in the ``/adalflow`` directory.
  Within this directory, the ``/adalflow`` contains the source code, and the ``/tests`` contains test code.
  3 labels here include: ``integration``, ``improvement``, ``core feature``.

  - We use ``bug`` for code-related issues across all directories.
  - ``documentation`` for items in the ``/docs``, ``/tutorials``, ``/use_cases``, ``/benchmarks``, and ``/notebooks`` directories.
  - ``new use cases/benchmarks`` for issues in ``/use_cases`` and ``/benchmarks``.
  - ``question`` for general inquiries.

* How to proceed: There are 4 labels.

  - ``good first issue`` for tasks suitable for new contributors.
  - ``wontfix`` for issues that won‚Äôt be addressed in the library.
  - ``duplicate`` for issues already tracked elsewhere.
  - ``help wanted`` indicates priority signal, discussion, and pr are needed.

* Priority: There are 3 levels.

  - ``P0`` for the highest priority issues.
  - ``P1`` for medium priority.
  - ``P2`` for the lowest priority.


.. note::
   * All the above 14 labels can be used for both issues and PRs.
   * ``ready-for-pr`` is exclusive to issues and indicates the issue is ready for a PR.
   * ``ready-to-go`` is exclusive to PRs and indicates the PR is ready to be merged.

This following table will provide a quick overview of them all.

How to create an issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We‚Äôve created five templates to make it easy for you to create an issue.

.. figure:: ../_static/images/adalflow_issue_template.png
   :alt: AdalFlow Issue Template
   :align: center
   :width: 700px

   Five templates for creating issues

Each template automatically assigns relevant labels to the issue.


How to assign priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While our team marks priorities based on our best judgment, we also welcome community input to help us prioritize issues.

You can use üëç to indicate how important a particular issue is to you.
We‚Äôll consider the ``# of üëç / time_period`` as an additional signal for setting priorities.



Part 2: What to contribute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section provides more details on how each issue relates to our codebase.

.. _part3-contributing-steps:

Part 3: Contributing Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you know what you want to contribute, follow these steps to ensure the quality of your contribution:

1. **Track it.** Create an issue if it doesn‚Äôt already exist.
2. **Learn enough context.** Read the relevant documentation and code inside and outside of AdalFlow.
   This includes:

   - :ref:`tutorials<source-tutorials>`
   - :ref:`use_cases<use_cases>`
   - :ref:`API references<apis>`
   - tests within `/adalflow/tests` to understand everything you need to know.

   This will help you understand everything necessary for your contribution.
   We‚Äôll provide examples for each type of contribution in the next section.

   - For integration, you need to know the relevant SDKs and APIs.
   - For documentation, you need to know the structure of the documentation and the writing style.

3. **Create a solution proposal and gather input.** Write your solution proposal in the issue comments.
   Alternatively, you can use a publically accessible tool like ``Google Doc`` or ``Colab`` to share your proposal.
   The `AdalFlow` team and the community will review and provide feedback before your start coding.
   The team and core contributors can label it as ``ready-for-pr`` when it is ready for a PR.
   This step is especially crucial for complex features. You can also discuss your proposal on our `Discord <https://discord.com/invite/ezzszrRZvT>`_.

4. **Work on it.**  Follow the `PR & Review Process <#pr-review-process>`_ to begin coding, testing, documenting, and reviewing.

Integrate a  model_client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All existing :ref:`model clients<components-model_client>` are located in the `/adalflow/adalflow/components/model_client` directory.
The tutorial :ref:`model_client<tutorials-model_client>` will help you understand the base class and how it is designed.

In general, `OpenAI SDK <https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart>`_ is trending to the the industry standard.
And you can measure your targetting SDKs by the difference between these two.
But overall, the OPENAI integration consists of: coding, testing, documentation.

Coding includes:

1. A :ref:`OpenAIClient<components-model_client-openai_client>` class that inherits from the base class :ref:`ModelClient<core.model_client>`.
2. Add the `sdk package` as an optional package in the `adalflow/pyproject.toml` file.
3. Add the `sdk package` as lazy import in the `adalflow/adalflow/utils/lazy_import.py` file.
4. Call the lazy import in the `adalflow/adalflow/components/model_client/__init__.py` file.
5. Import the new client in the `adalflow/adalflow/__init__.py` file so that we can call it directly from the `adalflow` package.

Testing includes:

1. Create a test file `test_XX_client.py` in the `adalflow/tests/` directory. You can use `test_openai_client.py` as a reference.
2. Add the package to the `adalflow/pyproject.toml` file under the `[tool.poetry.group.test.dependencies]` section.
3. Add the test case for the new client in the test file.
4. Follow the `adalflow/tests/README.md` to run the test.

Documentation includes:

1. Add examples on how to use the new client in the `tutorials` directory. You can use `tutorials/ollama_client_note.py` as a reference.
2. Make sure you add the new client package in the root `pyproject.toml` file under the `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` section.
3. Ensure the API reference is correctly rendenered in the `docs` directory.
   For example, with `ollama_client`, you need to add the following line in the `docs/source/apis/components/index.rst` file:

   .. code-block:: text

      components.model_client.ollama_client

4. Add examplary API configurations in the root `.env_example` file.


This `ollama_client PR <https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/AdalFlow/pull/97>`_ is a good example of how to integrate a new model client.

Integrate a database retriever
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All existing :ref:`retrievers<components-retriever>` are located in the `/adalflow/adalflow/components/retriever` directory.
The tutorial :ref:`retriever<tutorials-retriever>` will help you understand the base class and how it is designed.

The process is quite similar to integrating a model client. For documentation, ensure you add an example in :ref:`retriever<tutorials-retriever>`.

This `qdrant_retriever PR <https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/AdalFlow/pull/165>`_ is a good example of how to integrate a new database retriever.

Add notebooks for existing/new tutorials/use_cases/benchmarks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: ../_static/images/adalflow_code_samples.png
   :alt: Code samples for tutorials

   :align: center
   :width: 700px

   Code samples for tutorials


.. note::
  For how to add a new notebook, please follow the `README.md <https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/AdalFlow/blob/main/notebooks/README.md>`_ in the `notebooks` directory.

**Tutorials**

For :ref:`tutorials<tutorials>` in our documentation, each tutorial is accompanied by two code files: one `XX_note.py` in `/tutorials` and one `adalflow_XX.ipynb` in `/notebooks/tutorials`.
You can help add the missing code file in tutorials and make sure to link them in the documentation like the above figure.
Here is one example issue and PR for adding a new tutorial: `Issue 192 <https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/AdalFlow/issues/192>`_ and `PR 261 <https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/AdalFlow/pull/261>`_.

**Use Cases**

For :ref:`use_cases<use_cases>` in our documentation, each use case is accompanied by source code in `/use_cases` and a notebook in `/notebooks/use_cases`.
For our existing use cases, we do not always have the corresponding notebooks. You can help add the missing notebooks for the existing use cases.

**Benchmarks**

So far, we are still working on the code in the `/benchmarks` directory. We will need help on addint the documentation along with the code.

Part 4: Pull Request Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prepare the codebase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can start a pull request, you need to follow these steps and this `Github official fork guide <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo?tool=webui>`_:

1. **Fork the repository.**
   You can fork the repository by clicking the `Fork` button on the top right corner of the repository page.

2. **Clone the repository.**
   You can clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone your_forked_repository_url

3. **Sync your fork.**
   Also, make sure your repository is in sync with the original owner's repository. You can do this by running the following commands:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git remote -v

   You will not see our repo in the list. You can add it by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git remote add upstream https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/AdalFlow.git

   Now, when you run `git remote -v`, you will see the upstream repo.
   Then, we can sync your fork with the upstream repo by running the following commands:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git fetch upstream
      git checkout main
      git merge upstream/main

   *Note: `fetch` will fetch the changes from the upstream repo, but it will not merge them into your local branch. `merge` will merge the changes from the upstream repo into your local branch.*
   For more detials, please refer to the `Github official syncing a fork guide <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork>`_.

4. **Create a new branch.**
   Create a new branch to ensure your changes are isolated from the main codebase. You can do this by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git checkout -b <issue_number>_<issue_title>

   Similarly, you always use step 3 to sync your branch with the upstream repo.
   Additionally, you can use the following commands to sync:

   .. code-block:: bash

     git fetch --all --prune
     git rebase upstream/main
     # follow git instructions to resolve conflicts
     git push origin your_branch_name


Work on your PR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Set up the pre-commit hooks.**
   We have a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the root directory.
   Ensure you have set up the pre-commit hooks. We recommend you to do so in the `poetry` environment.
   The following steps will help you set up the root poetry environment and the pre-commit hooks:
   Install `poetry` if you haven't already:

   .. code-block:: bash

    pip install poetry

   You can install the dependencies by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

    poetry install

   Then you can activate the environment by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

    poetry shell

   Then, install the pre-commit hooks by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

    pre-commit install

   *Now, you can start to commit your changes from the `/adalflow` directory next time even if you are not in the poetry environment.*
   If you have more questions, you can refer to the `pre-commit official guide <https://pre-commit.com/#install>`_.

2. **Commit your changes.**
   Once you have made your changes, you can commit them by running the following commands:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git add .
      git commit -m "Your commit message"
      git push origin your_branch_name

   If you face "permission denied" issue, you can refer to this `medium blog <https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-change-your-github-remote-authentication-from-username-password-to-personal-access-token-64e527a766cf>`_ for help.

3. **Create a Pull Request.**
   Go to your forked repository on Github and click the `New Pull Request` button. Make sure you select the correct branch for the base and compare branches.
   Here we have a default `PR template <https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/adalflow/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md>`_ for you to fill in.

4. **Fill in the PR template.**
   Make sure you fill in the PR template with the necessary information. This will help the reviewers understand your changes better.

5. **Submit the PR**
   We encourage you to submit the PR as soon as possible, even if it is not ready for review. You can mark it as a draft by:
   1. Clicking the `Draft` button on the PR page.
   2. Adding `[WIP]` to the PR title.

   .. figure:: ../_static/images/pr_draft.png
      :alt: Create a draft PR
      :align: center
      :width: 700px

      Create a draft PR

6. **Iterate your PR.**
   Once you have submitted the PR, the reviewers will review your changes and provide feedback. You can iterate your PR by making the necessary changes and pushing them to your branch. The reviewers will review your changes again.

7. **Merge your PR.**
   Once your PR is approved, the reviewers will merge your PR for you. You can also merge your PR by clicking the `Merge` button on the PR page.



Part 5: Review Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For now, we will use the `PyTorch lightning's review guideline <https://github.com/Lightning-AI/pytorch-lightning/wiki/Review-guidelines>`_.

.. Environment
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. When contributing, please note:
.. LightRAG separates the source code environment and documentation environment.

.. * To activate the code environment, you should run ``poetry install`` and ``poetry shell`` under ``./lightrag``. The ``./lightrag/pyproject.toml`` contains the dependencies for the ``LightRAG`` package.

.. * To activate the documentation environment, you can run ``poetry install`` and ``poetry shell`` under ``.``. The ``./pyproject.toml`` controls documentation dependencies.
