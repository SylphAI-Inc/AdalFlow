0. ABBR, Abbreviation
1. ENTY, Entity
2. DESC, Description and abstract concept
3. HUM, Human being
4. LOC, Location
5. NUM, Numeric value

<OUTPUT_FORMAT>
Your output should be formatted as a standard YAML instance with the following schema:
```
thought: Your reasoning to classify the question to class_name (str) (required)
class_name: class_name (str) (required)
class_index: class_index in range[0, 5] (int) (required)

0. ABBR, Abbreviation
1. ENTY, Entity
2. DESC, Description and abstract concept
3. HUM, Human being
4. LOC, Location
5. NUM, Numeric value

<OUTPUT_FORMAT>
Your output should be formatted as a standard YAML instance with the following schema:
```
thought: Your reasoning to classify the question to class_name (str) (required)
class_name: class_name (str) (required)
class_index: class_index in range[0, 5] (int) (required)

0. ABBR, Abbreviation
1. ENTY, Entity
2. DESC, Description and abstract concept
3. HUM, Human being
4. LOC, Location
5. NUM, Numeric value

<OUTPUT_FORMAT>
Your output should be formatted as a standard YAML instance with the following schema:
```
thought: Your reasoning to classify the question to class_name (str) (required)
class_name: class_name (str) (required)
class_index: class_index in range[0, 5] (int) (required)

0. ABBR, Abbreviation
1. ENTY, Entity
2. DESC, Description and abstract concept
3. HUM, Human being
4. LOC, Location
5. NUM, Numeric value

<OUTPUT_FORMAT>
Your output should be formatted as a standard YAML instance with the following schema:
```
thought: Your reasoning to classify the question to class_name (str) (required)
class_name: class_name (str) (required)
class_index: class_index in range[0, 5] (int) (required)
```

-Make sure to always enclose the YAML output in triple backticks (```). Please do not add anything other than valid YAML output!
-Follow the YAML formatting conventions with an indent of 2 spaces. 
-Quote the string values properly.

Format: class_index. class_name, class_description
0. ABBR, Abbreviation
1. ENTY, Entity
2. DESC, Description and abstract concept
3. HUM, Human being
4. LOC, Location
5. NUM, Numeric value

<OUTPUT_FORMAT>
Your output should be formatted as a standard YAML instance with the following schema:
```
thought: Your reasoning to classify the question to class_name (str) (required)
class_name: class_name (str) (required)
class_index: class_index in range[0, 5] (int) (required)
```

-Make sure to always enclose the YAML output in triple backticks (```). Please do not add anything other than valid YAML output!
-Follow the YAML formatting conventions with an indent of 2 spaces. 
-Quote the string values properly.
